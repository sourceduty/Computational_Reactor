================================================================
1. Neuron-Reaction Model
   A neuron-reaction model integrates neuron dynamics with reaction-based processes, allowing for the simulation of biochemically inspired computations.
   - Reaction-Diffusion Systems: Simulates chemical concentration changes over time, interacting with neuron dynamics.
   - Integrate-and-Fire with Reactions: Neurons respond to both electrical inputs and local chemical concentrations.

   Variables:
   - Membrane Potential (V)
   - Reaction Concentration (C)
   - Reaction Rate (k)
   - Firing Threshold (θ)

2. Synapse-Reaction Model
   Synapse-reaction models define the interaction between neurons and reaction processes.
   - Synaptic Weight (w): Modulated by chemical reactions or neurotransmitter concentrations.
   - Synaptic Delay (d): Time taken for both electrical and chemical signals to propagate.
   - Reaction Influence: Reaction dynamics alter synaptic efficacy (e.g., through ion channel modulation).

   Parameters:
   - Synaptic Conductance (g): Dependent on reaction states.
   - Neurotransmitter Concentration (T): Affects synaptic transmission strength.
   - Plasticity Rules: Coupled with reaction dynamics, such as concentration-dependent STDP.

3. Network Topology with Reaction Zones
   The network topology includes areas or zones where specific reactions occur, influencing local neuron behavior.
   - Reaction Zones: Regions with distinct chemical environments affecting neuron and synapse behavior.
   - Connectivity Patterns: Can be random, small-world, or scale-free, with additional reaction-driven modulation.

   Variables:
   - Number of Neurons (N)
   - Connectivity Matrix (C): Incorporates reaction-zone influences.
   - Reaction-Diffusion Matrix (R): Describes chemical concentration gradients.

4. Input Stimuli and Reaction Triggers
   External stimuli not only drive neuronal activity but also trigger or modulate local reactions.
   - Electrical Inputs: Standard inputs like Poisson spike trains or constant currents.
   - Chemical Inputs: Introduction of specific chemicals or molecules that influence reactions.

   Variables:
   - Input Type: Electrical, chemical, or combined.
   - Input Frequency and Duration
   - Chemical Injection Rate (r)

5. Simulation Dynamics and Reaction Integration
   The simulation evolves by simultaneously solving neuron dynamics, synaptic transmission, and reaction-diffusion equations.
   - Neuron Dynamics: Governed by standard neuronal equations (e.g., dV/dt).
   - Reaction-Diffusion Dynamics: Governed by partial differential equations (e.g., dC/dt = D∇²C - kC).
   - Interaction: Neuron firing can alter local chemical concentrations and vice versa.

   Equations:
   - Neuron Dynamics Equation
   - Reaction-Diffusion Equation
   - Synapse-Reaction Interaction

6. Global Network-Reaction Behavior
   Emergent phenomena that arise from the interplay of neuronal activity and reaction dynamics.
   - Oscillatory Behavior: Coupled electrical and chemical oscillations leading to synchronized network activity.
   - Pattern Formation: Emergence of spatial patterns in neuron activity linked to reaction-diffusion systems.
   - Memory and Learning: Chemical reactions modulate synaptic plasticity, leading to stable memory patterns.

7. Output Metrics and Reaction Analysis
   Tools for analyzing both neuronal and reaction-based outputs:
   - Raster Plot: Visualizes spike timings in relation to reaction zones.
   - Spike Rate and Reaction Concentration Profiles: Measures neuron activity and chemical concentrations over time.
   - Voltage and Concentration Traces: Records changes in membrane potential and reaction states.
   - Pattern Formation Analysis: Detects emergent patterns from reaction-diffusion and neuronal interactions.

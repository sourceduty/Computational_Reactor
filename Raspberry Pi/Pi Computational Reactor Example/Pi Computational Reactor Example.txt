Pi Computational Reactor Example

The goal is to create a system that processes data using different strategies via a set of bots and simulates their interactions. The project will be implemented on a Raspberry Pi.

Components Needed

- Raspberry Pi (any model with sufficient computational power, e.g., Raspberry Pi 4)
- Python (version 3.x)
- Libraries: numpy (for data processing)
- External Storage (optional, for saving large datasets)

Steps for Development

1. Setup Raspberry Pi

   - Install the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS.
   - Ensure Python 3.x and numpy are installed.

2. Develop and Test the Code

   - Use the provided code as a base for the project.
   - Save the code in a Python file, e.g., data_reactor.py.

3. Implement the Computational Data Reactor

   - Define the Bot class to handle different data processing strategies.
   - Define the ComputationalDataReactor class to manage data feeding, processing, and interactions between bots.

4. Write Data Processing Logic

   - Implement methods in the Bot class for different strategies: average, sum, max, and min.
   - Implement methods for interaction: cooperative and competitive.

5. Test the System

   - Create a main script to instantiate bots, configure the reactor, and feed sample data.
   - Verify if the interactions and data processing work as expected.

6. Deploy and Monitor

   - Run the final script on the Raspberry Pi.
   - Monitor performance and make adjustments if needed.

Detailed Code Plan

1. Bot Class

   - __init__(self, name, strategy): Initialize bot with a name and processing strategy.
   - process_data(self, data): Process data based on the selected strategy.
   - interact(self, other_bot, mode): Interact with another bot based on the mode (cooperative or competitive).
   - get_output(self): Return the processed data output.

2. ComputationalDataReactor Class

   - __init__(self, bots, interaction_mode): Initialize the reactor with bots and interaction mode.
   - feed_data(self, data): Feed data into the reactor.
   - run(self): Process data and simulate interactions between bots.
   - get_results(self): Collect and return the output data from all bots.

3. Example Usage

   - Instantiate multiple bots with different strategies.
   - Create a reactor and feed it with sample data.
   - Run the reactor and obtain results.

Additional Considerations

- Error Handling: Add error handling for edge cases and unexpected inputs.
- Performance: Optimize performance if handling large datasets or many bots.
- Scalability: Consider how the system will scale if more bots or different strategies are added.

===============================================================
1. Neuron Model  
   A neuron model governs the dynamics of individual neurons in the network. Popular models include:
   - Integrate-and-Fire: Simple model capturing basic neuron behavior.
   - Hodgkin-Huxley: Biophysically realistic, models ion channel dynamics.
   - Izhikevich: Balances biological realism with computational efficiency.

   Variables:
   - Membrane Potential (V)
   - Input Current (I)
   - Firing Threshold (Î¸)

2. Synapse Model
   Synapses define the interaction between neurons. This includes synaptic weights, delays, and plasticity.
   - Synaptic Weight (w): Strength of connection.
   - Synaptic Delay (d): Time taken for signal transmission.
   - Plasticity: Synaptic changes based on activity patterns, often modeled by rules like:
     - Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP): Strength changes based on timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes.
     - Hebbian Learning: "Cells that fire together wire together."

3. Network Topology
   The organization of neurons into a network, which influences global behavior.
   - Random: Neurons are randomly connected.
   - Small-world: Highly clustered with short paths, mimicking biological networks.
   - Scale-free: Some neurons (hubs) have disproportionately many connections, as seen in real brain networks.

   Parameters:
   - Number of neurons (N)
   - Connectivity matrix (C): Defines connections between neurons.

4. Input Stimuli
   External inputs to drive the network or induce activity patterns.
   - Poisson Spike Train: Simulates random spiking behavior, typically used for sensory-like input.
   - Constant Current: Continuous external drive, simulating a persistent stimulus.

   Variables:
   - Input type
   - Frequency of input
   - Duration of stimulation

5. Simulation Dynamics
   Governs the evolution of neuron states over time. The simulation evolves by integrating the differential equations governing each neuron's dynamics.

   Equations:
   - Neuron dynamics equation (e.g., Hodgkin-Huxley: dV/dt = f(V, I))
   - Synaptic transmission (delayed integration based on presynaptic spikes)
   - Plasticity rules applied after spike events.

6. Global Network Behavior
   Emergent phenomena resulting from the interaction of many neurons. This could include:
   - Synchronized Firing: Neurons fire together, leading to network-wide oscillations.
   - Criticality: The network operates near a critical point, maximizing computational power.
   - Memory Formation: Emergence of stable patterns of synaptic weights, representing learned information.

7. Output Metrics
   Measurement and analysis of network behavior post-simulation:
   - Raster Plot: Visualizes neuron spike timings across the network.
   - Spike Rate: Measures the average firing rate of neurons.
   - Voltage Trace: Records the membrane potential over time for individual neurons.
   - Synaptic Weight Distribution: Tracks how synaptic strengths change throughout the simulation.

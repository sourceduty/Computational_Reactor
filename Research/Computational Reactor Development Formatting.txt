Computational Reactor Development Formatting

1. Node Format

Basic Node Structure:

- Node Name: Identifier for the node in the reactor process (e.g., A, B, C).
- Function: The role or operation of the node (e.g., react, transform, split).
- Inputs: Reactants or materials entering the node.
- Outputs: Products or materials exiting the node.

2. Arrow Format

Arrow Representation:

- Direction: Indicates the flow from one node to another.
- Type: Solid for direct transformations, dashed for conditional or feedback flows.
- Annotation: Information about the transformation or flow rate.

3. Dynamics Format

Operational Dynamics:

- Merging: Combine reactants (e.g., A + B → AB)
- Splitting: Divide reactants (e.g., AB → A + B)
- Transformation: Change in the state or composition (e.g., A → B)
- Feedback: Conditional dynamics affecting prior nodes

4. Units Format

Unit Representation:

- Reactant Quantities: The number of units for each reactant or product.
- Measurement: Use consistent units (e.g., moles, grams).
- Change: Indicate increases or decreases in units during reactions.

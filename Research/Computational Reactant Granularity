Computational reactant granularity refers to the level of detail at which individual reactants and their interactions are modeled in simulations. Increasing granularity involves representing reactants and their properties, such as molecular structures, binding sites, and kinetic behaviors, with more precision. This heightened detail allows for a more accurate prediction of the outcomes of chemical reactions, particularly in complex systems where minor variations can lead to significantly different products. By enhancing granularity, simulations can capture subtle differences in reaction pathways and intermediate states, thereby improving the accuracy of predictions for product variants.

Increased granularity is essential for applications requiring high specificity, such as pharmaceutical development, where the exact configuration of a molecular product can determine its efficacy or toxicity. By modeling reactants at a finer level, computational simulations can account for variables like stereochemistry and electronic effects, which are critical for accurately predicting the formation and stability of different product variants. This approach not only enhances the precision of the simulations but also enables the exploration of a broader range of possible outcomes, supporting the optimization of processes and the discovery of new, potentially beneficial product variants.

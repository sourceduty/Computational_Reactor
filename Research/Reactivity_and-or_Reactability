Reactivity refers to the intrinsic tendency of a substance to undergo a chemical reaction when it comes into contact with another substance or specific conditions. This is determined by the chemical structure, bonding, and energy levels of the substance. Highly reactive substances can quickly and vigorously react, often producing noticeable effects like heat, light, or explosions. Reactivity is a fundamental property that doesn't change unless the substance itself is altered.

Reactability, however, is a broader concept that includes not only the substance's inherent reactivity but also how easily or likely it is for a reaction to occur in a given environment. Factors like temperature, pressure, and the presence of catalysts can influence reactability. While a substance may have high reactivity, its reactability could vary depending on the surrounding conditions, which can either accelerate or inhibit the reaction. In essence, reactability reflects both the substanceâ€™s potential to react and the practicality of the reaction taking place under real-world conditions.

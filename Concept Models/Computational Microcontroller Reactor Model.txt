   e. Configure GPIO for Cooling Fan control

2. Enter main control loop:
   a. Read temperature from DS18B20 sensor
      - Use 1-Wire protocol to communicate
   b. Read pressure from MPX5700AP sensor
      - Use ADC to convert analog signal to digital value
   c. If Temperature < 60°C:
        i. Set PWM duty cycle to increase Heating Element output
      Else If Temperature > 80°C:
        i. Set PWM duty cycle to zero to deactivate Heating Element
   d. If Pressure > 600 kPa:
        i. Set GPIO pin HIGH to turn on Cooling Fan
      Else If Pressure < 500 kPa:
        i. Set GPIO pin LOW to turn off Cooling Fan
   e. Wait for 1 second before next iteration

The ATmega2560-based model described above serves as an illustrative example of a Computational Microcontroller Reactor, a system designed to control and monitor environmental parameters such as temperature and pressure. By leveraging the capabilities of the ATmega2560 microcontroller, this model can efficiently handle real-time data acquisition from sensors, process control signals for actuators, and ensure the system remains within predefined safety limits. The framework incorporates a digital temperature sensor and an analog pressure sensor to provide accurate feedback, which is crucial for maintaining stable operation. The microcontroller's peripheral interfaces, including ADC, PWM, and GPIO, facilitate seamless integration of sensors and actuators, enabling precise control over a heating element and a cooling fan. The control logic is implemented as a continuous loop, ensuring regular monitoring and adjustment of system conditions, thus allowing the reactor to respond dynamically to changes in its environment.

This model exemplifies how microcontrollers like the ATmega2560 can be used in embedded systems to create robust and scalable solutions for environmental control in small-scale reactors. The incorporation of safety protocols, such as overtemperature shutdown and overpressure relief, highlights the importance of fault detection and mitigation strategies in maintaining system integrity and preventing accidents. Furthermore, the system's ability to log data and perform periodic self-tests demonstrates how computational microcontroller reactors can not only maintain operational stability but also provide valuable diagnostic information for future analysis and optimization. This approach allows for continuous improvement and adaptation, making it a powerful tool in various applications, from industrial process control to research and educational settings, where reliability and safety are paramount.

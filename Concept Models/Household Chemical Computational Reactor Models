The Carbon Dioxide Synthesis Reactor uses a reaction between acetic acid (vinegar) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to produce carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water, and sodium acetate. This setup operates as a continuous flow reactor, where the reactants are mixed in controlled amounts to ensure a consistent and efficient production of CO2. The process is conducted at room temperature with slightly elevated pressure to optimize the capture of CO2 gas, making it suitable for applications such as beverage carbonation, fire extinguishers, and dry ice production. Proper venting and monitoring systems are integrated to handle gas pressure and ensure safe operation.

The Chloramine Synthesis Reactor is designed for producing chloramines, a disinfectant widely used in water treatment. This model involves the reaction of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) with ammonia, producing chloramines and sodium hydroxide. The reaction takes place in a batch reactor with precise control over temperature and pH to optimize chloramine formation while minimizing the release of hazardous gases. Continuous stirring and gas scrubbers are used to manage reaction by-products, ensuring that the chloramines are produced in a controlled and safe manner for sanitizing municipal water supplies and other sanitation applications.

The Oxygen Generation Reactor utilizes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) catalyzed by substances like manganese dioxide or potassium iodide to produce oxygen gas and water. This model operates as a continuous flow system where hydrogen peroxide is passed over a catalyst bed, facilitating rapid decomposition. The setup is maintained at ambient or slightly elevated temperatures to enhance reaction rates without causing uncontrolled decomposition. The reactor is designed to safely capture the oxygen gas for use in medical oxygen generation, industrial oxidation processes, and wastewater treatment, while managing the corrosive nature of concentrated hydrogen peroxide through careful handling and safety measures.

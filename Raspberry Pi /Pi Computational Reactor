A computational reactor using Raspberry Pi hardware simulates the operations of a nuclear reactor, combining real-world electronic components and computational simulations. This setup provides an educational platform where users can explore and control various reactor parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and control rod positions, in real-time. Sensors monitor these variables, while actuators like servo motors mimic the physical movements within a reactor. By integrating these elements, the project offers a hands-on learning experience, allowing users to engage with the principles of reactor physics, safety mechanisms, and data monitoring.

To achieve these objectives, the Raspberry Pi 4 is chosen for its processing power, suitable for handling multiple sensors, data analysis, and graphical outputs. The device runs on the Raspberry Pi OS, providing a stable environment for developing and executing the projectâ€™s software. Real-time data is displayed on an LCD screen, and physical buttons offer direct interaction. Additionally, remote monitoring and data logging are enabled through network connectivity, allowing users to analyze historical data and adjust parameters from anywhere. Safety features and realistic simulations ensure that the project not only educates but also reflects the complexities and challenges of managing a real nuclear reactor.
